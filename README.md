### Description

A usercontrol that allows the user to use 1 of the 8 supplied clock images or supply there own. The user has full control over all aspects of the graphics; Background, Hour/Minute/Second hands, Logo and highlighting overlay.

You can set the transparency level of each graphic element, position the logo anywhere on the clock background.

All images are provided in .PNG format for full transparency.

Special thanks go to LaVolpe for his 32bbpDIB class, without which this project would not have been possible. *** Note: For optimal performance you should have GDI+ (GDI Plus) installed. If you do not, then I recommend downloading it for FREE from Microsoft, it is available for systems with Windows 98 and later.
